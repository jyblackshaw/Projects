Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a collection of diverse projects spanning research, game development, and academic explorations. Each project showcases my passion for innovation, problem-solving, and continuous learning in the realm of computer science.

## Projects Overview

### Research
- [**Optimizing Foliage Density Estimation for NYC**](https://github.com/jyblackshaw/Optimizing-Foliage-Density-Estimation-for-NYC-): An exploration into optimizing foliage density estimation with a focus on NYC.
- [**Nasa L'Space PDR Proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bmLl8pCfGfXXZ5I0xZVvGx611Hoqt36/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117332866483455348871&rtpof=true&sd=true): Red Delta's rover mission proposal to study water presence and habitability on Mars. I was a member of the Computer Handware Engineer and Programmatics teams.
